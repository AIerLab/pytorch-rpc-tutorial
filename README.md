# RPC Tutorial Overview

Welcome to this tutorial series on RPC (Remote Procedure Call) with PyTorch. Here's a structured overview of the content, progressing from simpler to more complex topics:

---

## Topics Covered

1. **One-to-One RPC:**
   - A simple demonstration of a server and a worker, emphasizing their master-slave relationship.
   - Tips on maintaining consistency in project structure across nodes for efficient RPCs.

2. **One-to-Many RPC:**
   - Deep dive into the master-slave architecture.
   - Understand how a single master can distribute tasks to multiple workers.

3. **Chain Many Nodes:**
   - Run and understand a chain of nodes, from `start` to `middle` to `end`.
   - Emphasis on the importance of the order of operations in synchronous communication.

4. **Many-to-One Communication:**
   - Setup and run a scenario where multiple clients communicate with a single server.
   - Importance of using `rpc_async` over `rpc_sync` in scenarios where non-blocking operations are crucial.

5. **Split Learning with PyTorch Distributed RPC:**
   - An introduction to the concept of split learning and its advantages.
   - How to implement split learning using the PyTorch Distributed RPC framework.

## Observations and Tips

### rpc is quite similar to ros2, am I right?

Yes, in some ways, PyTorch's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework is similar to ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) in that they both allow for distributed computing and interprocess communication.

1. **Inter-Process Communication:** Both RPC and ROS2 facilitate inter-process communication, which is the exchange of data across multiple and potentially distributed processes.

2. **Remote Procedure Calls:** RPC and ROS2 both support the idea of remote procedure calls, allowing a process to invoke a procedure or method in another process either on the same machine or another machine on the network. In ROS2, this is facilitated through services, while in PyTorch, it's done through the RPC API.

3. **Asynchronous Communication:** Both systems provide support for both synchronous and asynchronous communication. In PyTorch, `rpc_sync` and `rpc_async` handle this, while ROS2 provides similar functionality with services (synchronous) and topics (asynchronous).

However, it's also important to note that the two systems have been developed for very different purposes. PyTorch RPC is primarily meant for distributed deep learning, while ROS2 is designed for the needs of complex robotic systems. This results in some key differences in their architecture and usage. For instance, ROS2 has a more comprehensive system for message passing, with well-defined message types, topics, and services, and it supports real-time communication, which is crucial in robotics applications.
